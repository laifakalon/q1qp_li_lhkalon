                    The two economic aspects, the GDP Growth Rate and the Unemployment Rate,
                     both give us a perspective on the fatal effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic. 
                <br>
                <p>
                    Throughout the years wherein the pandemic took place,
                    we have analyzed that 2020 is really the year wherein the effects of the pandemic were felt in these two economic aspects. 
                    The year is characterized by an abrupt drop in economic activity, as evidenced by the GDP Growth Rate being negative, and a significant increase in unemployment.
                    The events of 2020 left a lasting imprint that serves as a stark reminder of the pandemic's ability to disrupt and reshape economic landscapes, 
                    even though the years that followed showed signs of recovery and stabilization.
