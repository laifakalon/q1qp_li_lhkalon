                    As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic brought upon a great impact on various aspects of the global landscape. 
                    The virus quickly spread across international borders, forcing governments, corporations, and individuals to adapt 
                    to a "new normal" that included lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social segregation policies.
                    It not only posed an unprecedented threat to public health, but also a significant and widespread economic turmoil.

                    The economic repercussions of the pandemic were significant, resulting in significant employment losses, as well as disruptions to global supply networks.
                     With that in mind, in this paper, we aim to correlate the Global GDP Growth Rate and the Global Unemployment Rate as affected by the pandemic. 
                     These are two key aspects of the global economy which, we believe, will help us have a greater comprehension of the effect of the pandemic on such economic aspects.

                    The data set used in this paper is composed of data from years 2019 up to 2022 
                    for the Quantitative Variables Monthly Global GDP Growth Rate and Monthly Global Unemployment Rate,
                    and Qualitative Variables Monthly Global GDP Growth Rate Change and Monthly Global Unemployment Rate Change. 
                    The data set is gathered from OECD Data (https://data.oecd.org/).
